VR Slideshow Sphere — Hosted-ready (Photos-only)

How to use:
1) Upload this folder to a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar). The site is fully client-side.
2) Open the hosted URL in your Quest browser (enter the link in the address bar).
3) Tap "Choose Files" and select the images you want from the Quest Gallery or Downloads.
4) Click "Start Slideshow" and then press the browser's "Enter VR" button to go into WebXR mode.
5) The scene shows 8 panels at a time, replaces 1 panel every 5 seconds, and loops when all images have been shown.

Notes:
- Medium panel sizing is the default; you can change panel size in the UI before starting.
- No images are uploaded to any server during slideshow; selected files are used locally in the browser session.
- If you want me to help deploy this to GitHub Pages or Netlify, I can provide step-by-step instructions.
